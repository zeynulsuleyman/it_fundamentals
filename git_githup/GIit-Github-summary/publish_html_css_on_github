Thanks Sergio Taco!

This is a tutorial for publishing your HTML/CSS workshop document on github.
Here are the steps:

1. First of all go to your github account by using your own credentials.
2. create a new repo:
	name: html/css-workshop.github.io
	public
	add a readme file
3. create a branch named "gh-pages"
4. upload your files
5. go to settings and find github pages
6. select "gh-pages" and save in the source section if not selected.
7. see the "Your site is published at https://sergiotaco.github.io/html-css-workshop/" warning at the same page and click the link.
8. your site has been published
